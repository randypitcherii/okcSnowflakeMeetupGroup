# OKC Snowflake Meetup Repo
Welcome to the OKC Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse User Group!

![Snowflake Logo](./snowflakeLogo.svg)

This group is dedicated to sharing technical best practices for using the Snowflake Cloud Data Warehouse!

All skill levels are welcome, but our main focus will be in hands-on collaboration, so get ready to put your hands on the keyboard!

Our events will take place monthly at different venues around the city (reach out if you're interested in hosting an event).

## Repo Structure
This repo is intended to host the code and other materials we use at our meets. See our past event information here and get ready for upcoming meets!
