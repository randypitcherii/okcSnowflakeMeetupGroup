# Meetup 2 | June 21, 2019
Welcome to round 2! In this meetup, we're going to give you the tools you'll need to build a clean and secure Snowflake instance.

We're going to focus on the most common activities needed to standup a fictitious `SALES` database to be used by the following peronas:
- the snowflake administrator (you)
- the data engineer
- the data scientist
- the business analyst

After this meetup, you should have the skills to avoid the major headaches that are most common to new Snowflake administrators. You will also have a set of templates you can use to perform your most common tasks in a reliable and repeatable way.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have access to a snowflake account that you can be admin of. If this isn't your work instance (or you don't have a work instance), [it's simple to sign up for a new account with tons of free credits here](https://trial.snowflake.com/).

If this is your first meetup event, also be sure to [run this basic setup script in Snowflake](../../meetupEnvironmentSetup.sql). This will create some core objects that are used across multiple meetups.
