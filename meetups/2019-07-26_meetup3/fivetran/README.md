## Fivetran Transformations

Fivetran released Fivetran Transformations at Snowflake Summit June 2019.

Fivetran has always maintained an **`EL`** approach to **`ETL`**.  [Fivetran Transformations](https://fivetran.com/blog/transformations) add the **`T`**, completing your replication stack.

The transformation layer is designed as a true post-load transformation solution, removing your need to build complicated triggers.  Your transformations may also be run on a set schedule.
